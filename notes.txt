- slate doc -> automerge doc (init)
  DONE?

- all slate operations -> apply to automerge doc (onchange)
- automerge doc -> slate doc (render is just this)

invariant:
toSlate(doOp(slateOp, toAutomerge(value)) = doOp(value)

- later: copy keys from one data structure to the other

================================================================

for cursor positions:
- emit over network connection
- local one we keep in component state, and apply manually to Value
- will remap *local selection only* based on automerge diff
  PROVIDED we can get the parent of a change, otherwise
  may need to pass path... :/

- this would end up being broadcast and received by other clients
